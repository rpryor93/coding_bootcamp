#Instructions

* Within your groups you are going to be creating a Node application called "Great-Bay" which allows users to create and bid on assorted items, tasks, jobs, or projects.

* The basic application is fairly simple: Upon loading up the program, the user is prompted on whether they would like to "POST AN ITEM" or "BID ON AN ITEM"

  * If the user selects to "POST AN ITEM" they are prompted for an assortment of information regarding the item and then that information is added to the database so that others can bid on it

  * If the user selects to "BID ON AN ITEM" they are shown a list of all available items and then are prompted to select what they would like to bid on. The console then asks them for how much they would like to bid. If the bid is higher, it replaces the previous amount. If the bid is lower, then it returns that the bid was too low and boots them back to the selection screen. If the bid is higher, it replaces the previous bid with the new one.

* Once your group has put together the basic application, it's time to test your collective skills on some of these addons. Remember to take into consideration the amount of time you have been given when choosing which addons you would like to try and tackle.
  
  * Create a sign-up and login system for users that prompts them for a username and password upon loading up the app. **Do not worry about setting up a truly secure database if you choose to tackle this addon. Just work on getting it to have working sign-up and login features.**

  * Create a system on the "POST AN ITEM" which allows users to look at the auctions they have created. On this screen they can add new auctions, modify previous auctions, or close bidding on an auction.

  * Create a system which allows users to view all of the auctions that they are the leading bidder of.

  * Create a third option on the main screen which allows for administrators to modify the database as they see fit.

  * Create visually appealing tables. This means making dynamic console code and it is a lot harder than it might seem at first so do not think this one is so simple.

  * Create a search function that allows users to look through the database of available auctions to find those that share the specified keyword or username.

  * Get creative! There are a lot of addons to this app which you could create so feel free to work with your group to come up with something we haven't yet!
