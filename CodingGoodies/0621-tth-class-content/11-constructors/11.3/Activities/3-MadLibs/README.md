* **Instructions**

    * Using inquirer, constructors, and callbacks, you are going to create a mad libs application which takes in user input and creates a story with those words entered.

    * Your constructor should be able to create objects with four properties...
        * An empty array of adjectives
        * An empty array of nouns
        * An empty array of verbs
        * An array or string which will contain all of the individual pieces of your story

    * Your inquirer prompts should be contained within a recursive function with a callback parameter which we will use to print out our final story

    * HINT: Keep in mind how you will select/replace specific elements when laying out the framework for your story and the callback function you will be using to create/print the final product.

    * HINT: Start out with a small and simple story before moving onto more complex tales.
