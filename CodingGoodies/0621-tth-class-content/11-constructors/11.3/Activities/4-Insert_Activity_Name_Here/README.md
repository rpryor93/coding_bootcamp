* **Instructions**

    * You now have at your disposal a wide variety of tools which you could use in order to create something rather impressive using Node.js. Your task for the next 40 minutes or so is to work alongside with another student to create a prototype for an application which includes the following...

        * Constructors

        * User input

        * Callback functions

    * BEWARE THE DREADED SCOPE CREEP! You and your partner only have a limited amount of time to create an application, so start out with something simplistic and then work your way up from there once the initial application is functioning properly.

    * HINT: Remember, you have a whole bunch NPM packages just sitting out there waiting to be used. If you think there is some prewritten code out there which you can use, check online to see if you can save yourself some time.

    * HINT: After time has run up, we will be asking random groups to come up and share their applications with the class. So, once again, BEWARE THE DREADED SCOPE CREEP!
