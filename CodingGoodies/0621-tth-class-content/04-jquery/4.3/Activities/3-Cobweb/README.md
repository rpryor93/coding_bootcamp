* **Instructions:**

* Create the missing the code such that you can retrieve the requested item from theCobWeb object.

* Note: This exercise is actually very relevant to work as a web developer, as data is often relayed across websites in the form of deeply nested Javascript Objects like this one.

* Bonus: If you finish, early begin pondering the bonus item. This is a VERY challenging exercise. Don't expect us to give you the solution (because we won't). It's one of those challenges that will leave you banging your head against the wall.
