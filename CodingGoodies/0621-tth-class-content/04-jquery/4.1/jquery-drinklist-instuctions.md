* **File:**

	* jQueryDrinkList_Unsolved.html (4-jQueryDrinkList)

* **Instructions:**

	* Re-factor (re-write) your previous drinkList code from earlier, but this time use jQuery to complete all of the same tasks.

	* Your final code should NOT have any of the following methods: `createElement`, `innerHTML`, or `appendChild`.

	* HINT: Don’t forget to “incorporate” jQuery before you begin.
