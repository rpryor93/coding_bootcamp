* **Instructions:**

* Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.

* If they respond with "yes" then write the following to the page: “Here’s a Steak Sandwich”

* If they respond with "no" then write the following to the page: “Here’s a tofu stir fry”

* Bonus: Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, post: “No Sake for you!”

* Hint: You will need to use document.write() from a few slides back.
