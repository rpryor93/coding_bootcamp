* **Instructions:**

	* Take a few moments to look over the following file with a partner.

	* Then create a comment line above each console.log() line to “predict” what the output will be.

	* HINT: Comments are the "//" you see with the grayed lines. These are ignored by Javascript and are available so other developers know what you mean when you coded something. Commenting your code is an extremely useful habit to get into as it will also help you better understand the applications you coded when you look back at them.
