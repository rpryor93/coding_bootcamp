* **Instructions:**

	* Using the code sent to you from the previous activity as a starting point, create a complete application such that:

		* Users can enter keyboard input (letters)

		* These letters then trigger the car’s functions to get run

		* These letters also trigger a global function called reWriteStats() that logs the car’s make, model, color, mileage, and isWorking status to the console.

		* HINT: Look into the document.onkeyup() function to help you collect user input from the keyboard.
