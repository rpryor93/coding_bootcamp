## 5.3 Lesson Plan - Chrome Debugger & Interview Questions

### Overview
In this class, we will be introducing ways to debug using Google Chrome's built in dev tools, as well as presenting students with a number of sample interview questions.

##### Instructor Priorities:

##### Instructor Notes:

### Class Objectives:

### 1. Instructor Talk: Welcome

* Welcome students to class and introduce today's topics. One of the most important parts of being a web developer is being able to look through your own code (as well as others') and diagnose problems. Let the students know that chrome dev tools are an invaluable tool in helping them do this.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Breakpoints

* Open up `debugger_1.html` in the browser and show students how to navigate to the soruces tab. Explain what breakpoints are and how they are useful in debugging code. Demonstrate their functionality by running `debugger_1.html` first without breakpoints, and then again with breakpoints inserted in the appropriate places. Illustrate how the code stops running until we tell it to proceed.

### 3. Students Do: Breakpoint Math

* Slack out the following file and instructions to students

* File:

	* `debugger_2.html`

* Instructions:

	* Open the file `debugger_2.html` in sublime and follow the instructions.

### 4. Students Do: Advanced Console Logging

* Review the answers to the previous activity.

* Why would being able to set breakpoints in code be valuable?

* Slack out `advanced_console_logging.html` and give students a few minutes to look over the file. Encourage them to take some time and play around with different ways of logging to the console. Why might these be useful?
