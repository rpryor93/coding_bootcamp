<!-- INSTRUCTIONS: 
	- Assign one member of your group as the keyboard operator. 
	- All others in the group will help supervise, offer guidance, and help catch bugs that the group's typist might not be able to catch.
		-- Watching the keyboard operator intently and adding constructive inputs in a timely manner is of the utmost importance!
	- Throughout this activity (and many of today's activities) you will be switching roles with those in your group.
	- Then create a Basic To-Do application using the 1-student-do-todolist.html (unsolved) as a starting point.
	- The HTML is already created for you so you will only have to fill in the javascript sections where there are large blanks.
	- Alternatively, if you are feeling bold and capable, your group may code it from scratch without the use of the base code provided.
	- Helpful Hint: Each of the buttons and text elements should have a dynamically created identifier or data attribute that differentiates one item on the list from another. 
	- You should use these attributes to close out the appropriate items when you click on the "X" beside them.

// ============================= START CODING BELOW! =============================================

// Create an initial todoCount variable



// On Click event associated with the addTodo function
$("#addTodo").on("click", function(){

	// Get the Todo "value" from the textbox



	// Create a new todo <p> tag in jquery  to hold a todoitem and give it a unique identifier based on what number it is in the list. 
	// Then give it an ID of the form: "item-4" or "item-3" or "item-99", where the number is equal to toDoCount.
	// Then append the todo text to this <p> element.



	// Create a button with unique identifers based on what number it is in the list. Again use jquery to do this.
	// Give your button a data attribute called data-todo and a class called "checkbox".
	// Lastly append a letter X inside.  




	// Append the button to the todoitem



	// Add the button and todo item to the todos div



	// Clear the textbox when done



	// Add to the todoCount



	// Prevent Form from Refreshing (return false)
	return false;
});

// When a user clicks a check box then delete the specific content 
// (NOTE: Pay attention to the unusual syntax here for the click event. Because we are creating click events on "dynamic" content, we can't just use the usual "on" "click" syntax.)
$(document.body).on('click', '.checkbox', function(){

	// Get the todoNumber of the button from its data attribute.



	// Empty the specific <p> element that previously held the todo item.



});
