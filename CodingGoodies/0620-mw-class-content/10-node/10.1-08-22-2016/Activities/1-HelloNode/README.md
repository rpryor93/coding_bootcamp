 **Instructions:**

	* Create a file called `Sriracha.js` somewhere on your computer.

	* Inside the file write Javascript to log the words: "Sriracha. Goes great on.... nothing." (or everything. You choose.)

	* Then run the program using Node in your terminal/bash window.

	* Confirm that it logged the text as you would expect.
