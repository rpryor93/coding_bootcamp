Add the viewport meta in the index.html file (Part2), and change @media in css (below is only one of many ways to do it).  Part1 was pretty self-explanatory with the biggest issue being pushing to Heroku.  Remember that index.php and composer.json must be in the directory that you `heroku create`  For styling purposes, it works out better if your primary webpage file (index.html) is in this same directory as well.

        border-bottom: 1px solid black;
        width: 100%;
